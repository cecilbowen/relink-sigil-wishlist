finish sidequest items 
add non-sigil items to sidequests, for posterity
have exclude search not show a lot if a searched item is not in it 
remove empty results from table
remove empty results from old ui quest table 
add item images if i ever have nothing else to do for a weekend
better communicate visually what a lot is and how drops are chosen from them
    right now this is just shown as the gray-colored background groupings all drops are categorized into
    maybe something like an icon at the top-left corner of each lot that displays a info tooltip when hovered to the affect of:
        "rolls one of the following drops in this group"
add side goal items maybe (lol)
add march update quests to og quest table
